Authors proposed SpamTracker, a two-stage approach that clusters spamming IP addresses based on their sending behaviors to target domains and select the 
most similar cluster in terms of the sending patterns. The clustering stage utilizes the standard spectral clustering and yields a set of C clusters that each cluster is a set of IP addresses
which share the similar sending patterns. SpamTracker could easily incorporated with existing systems through XML interfaces. However, SpamTracker faces challenges in stability since it requires a large of
amount of data (spam emails and senders) to solve 2 main problems of any spam detectors: incompleteness and responsiveness.

==+== D. Strengths
==-==    What are the paper’s strengths? Just a couple sentences, please.
==-== Markdown styling and LaTeX math supported.

* I like the approach of using spectral clustering to discover sending patterns and cluster ip-address together. This method is scalable in solving the dynamicism of spamming IP addresses without manual or multi-end-user verification. 
* The selection of clustering algorithm is a good choice in solving the responsiveness of spam detectors. It solves both the incompleteness and responsiveness issues of spam detectors.
* The description of the algorithm is so detailed that I believe that the algorithm is reproducible. The reproduciability is important, especially in applied science fields like seucrity.

==+== E. Weaknesses
==-==    What are the paper’s weaknesses? Just a couple sentences, please.
==-== Markdown styling and LaTeX math supported.
* There is no comparison between spectral clustering and other algorithms. In other words, I am not convinced of choosing spectral clustering for clustering sending patterns. It would be better to perform multiple clustering algorithms on same datasets for this task.
* There is a lack of explanation and details of the reclustering method that I may have difficulties in reproducing it. 

==+== F. Comments for author
==-== Markdown styling and LaTeX math supported.
* Perhaps, Section 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 seem to repeat the content coverred in Section 3.2. It is better to combine Section 3 into Section 4.
