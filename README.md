# Vacation2AI
This consists:
* timeline-based AI/ML/DL projects that I have worked on
* Research papers that I have read and found interesting/practical
* Machine Learning Interview Prep

## Projects
### - 2018
- [Intro to Machine Learning final project: Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/quocdat32461997/Vacation2AI/blob/master/others/titanic_survival_rate_prediction.pdf) Trained and validated multiple ML algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression) on Titatnic dataset to predict the survival rate of Titatnic passengers

- [TCReepy](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/TCRecePy)
  - Implemented K-Nearest-Neighbor to learn informative positions of proteins in amino acids to distinguish two types of T cell receptor hypervariable CDR3 sequences.
  - Achived: Best Desk to Best Bedside Award at 2018 Med U-Hack at UT Southwestern
  
 - Neural Engineering research projects (2018 - 2019) advised by Prof. Tan Chin-Tuan at the Auditory Perception Engineering Laboratory, UT Dallas:
  - Neural Entrainment to Speech Envelope in response to Perceived Sound Quality
    - Utilized Regression algorithms to simulate neural perceptino to speaking languages and accurately identify active brain channels in response to speech to reduce signal noise in Brain-Computer-Interfaces
    - Accepted: to [IEEE Neural Engineering Conference 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8717078/)
  - Linear and Nonlinear Reconstruction of Speech Envelope from EEG
    - Developed a Denoising CNN-LSTM model with the signal augmentation method to reconstruct Speech from Neural Signals (2x accuracy than baseline models)
    - [Preprint](https://quocdat32461997.github.io/assets/linear_and_nonlinear_reconstruction_of_speech_envelope_from_eeg.pdf)
