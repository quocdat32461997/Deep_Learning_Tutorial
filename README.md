# Vacation2AI
This consists:
* timeline-based AI/ML/DL projects that I have worked on
* Research papers that I have read and found interesting/practical
* Machine Learning Interview Prep

## Projects
### - 2018
- [Intro to Machine Learning final project: Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/quocdat32461997/Vacation2AI/blob/master/others/titanic_survival_rate_prediction.pdf) Trained and validated multiple ML algorithms using *Scikit-learn* (**SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression**) on Titatnic dataset to predict the survival rate of Titatnic passengers

- [TCReepy](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/TCRecePy)
  - Implemented **K-Nearest-Neighbor** to learn informative positions of proteins in amino acids to distinguish two types of T cell receptor hypervariable CDR3 sequences.
  - Achived: Best Desk to Best Bedside Award at 2018 Med U-Hack at UT Southwestern
  
### - 2019
- Neural Engineering research projects (2018 - 2019) advised by Prof. Tan Chin-Tuan at the Auditory Perception Engineering Laboratory, UT Dallas
- [Chest X-Ray Abnormal Detection](https://github.com/quocdat32461997/HealthCareAI_2019)
  - Applied multiple Transfer Learning models and hyper-parameter tuning to detect abnormalities in chest x-rays with 88% accuracy.
  - Achived: 1st Prize at the HealthCare AI 2019 Hackathon at Uni. of Texas at Dallas

### - 2020
- [MoCV](https://pypi.org/project/MoCV/)
  - An open-source Python package implementing **Computer Vision and Image Processing algorithms**.
 - [Senior Co-op Project: Interaction Tunning Tool](https://quocdat32461997.github.io/2020/05/05/interaction-tuning-tool-the-end_to_end-deep-learning_system-for-intent-detection.html)
    - Led a team of 6 engineers to build and deploy **an end-to-end Intent Extraction system** to **reduce the manual intent labeling tasks** (no coding and domain knowledge required) for Chatbot data preparation.
    - Contribution: utilized *StanfordNLP and Tensorflow* to develop a Deep Learning model (**LSTM-Attention + MLP**) to extract intents from raw utterances (**75% accuracy in development and 30% in deployment**). Unlike Google Dialogflow using a fixed intent list, our system forms VERB-NOUN intents that it does **not limit iteself by industry domains**
- [Name Entity Recognizer](https://github.com/quocdat32461997/NER) Implemented **BiLSTM-CRF** for **Name Entity Recognition**, built the data pipeline in *Tensorflow/Serving*, and deploy in *Flask*
- [NLP-course final project: Borot](https://github.com/quocdat32461997/borot)
    -	Built **Chatbot Question & Answering** with *Flask, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and SQL*.
    - Implemented **Information Retrieval** with **Intent Classifier (SVM), Name-Entity-Recognizer (BiLSTM-CRF) and TF-IDF** to retrieve answers in response to questions. Implemented OOP to collect usersâ€™ QA queries for personalization.
  
## Research
- Neural Entrainment to Speech Envelope in response to Perceived Sound Quality
  - Utilized Regression algorithms to simulate neural perceptino to speaking languages and accurately identify active brain channels in response to speech to reduce signal noise in Brain-Computer-Interfaces
  - Accepted: to [IEEE Neural Engineering Conference 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8717078/)
- Linear and Nonlinear Reconstruction of Speech Envelope from EEG
  - Developed a **Denoising CNN-LSTM model** with the **signal augmentation method** to reconstruct Speech from Neural Signals (2x accuracy than baseline models)
  - [Preprint](https://quocdat32461997.github.io/assets/linear_and_nonlinear_reconstruction_of_speech_envelope_from_eeg.pdf)
- Exploiting Context for Robust to Label Noise in Depression Diagnosis of Self-reported Statements
